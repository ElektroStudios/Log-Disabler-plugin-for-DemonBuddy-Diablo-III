# LogDisabler plugin for DemonBuddy

![](Images/Logo.png)

**LogDisabler** is a plugin for **DemonBuddy** (a bot for **Diablo III** videogame),
on which you can use this plugin to disable the creation of log files.

**DemonBuddy** performs thousands and thousands of disk I/O write operations in short periods of time for writing to log files; this can reduce the life of your hard-drive and also can cause an overall negative performance impact on your machine if other programs are requesting to perform other disk I/O operations simultaneously.

If you don't need to view/manage the log files created by **DemonBuddy**, then there is no good reason why you are still allowing it to create these logs. To prevent this behavior, **LogDisabler** can be used to deny write permissions for the current user on the 'Logs' folder inside **DemonBuddy** directory.

Note that this plugin does not disable logging messages in the user-interface, you can still use **DemonBuddy** settings to disable that.
