# LogDisabler plugin for DemonBuddy

![](images/Logo.png)

**LogDisabler** is a plugin for **DemonBuddy** (a bot for **Diablo III** videogame),
on which you can use this plugin to disable the creation of log files.

**DemonBuddy** performs thousands and thousands of I/O disk write operations in short periods of time for writing log files; this can reduce the life of your hard-drive and also can cause an overall negative performance impact on your system if other programs are requesting to perform other I/O disk operations simultaneously. 

If you don't need to manage the log files created by **DemonBuddy**, then there is no good reason why you are allowing **DemonBuddy** to create these logs. The problem here is **DemonBuddy** does not provide a built-in feature to disable log file creation, and this is why you should use **LogDisabler** plugin.
